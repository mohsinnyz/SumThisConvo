# --- Phase 1: Data Pipeline ---
dvc[gdrive]     # For data versioning with Google Drive
pandas          # For data manipulation
datasets        # For loading the SAMSum dataset from Hugging Face
tqdm            # Progress bars (always useful)

# --- Phase 2 & 3: Training, Evaluation & Tracking ---
transformers    # Core Hugging Face library
accelerate      # For easy multi-GPU/TPU/CPU training
bitsandbytes    # For 8-bit/4-bit quantization (QLoRA)
peft            # Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA)
torch           # PyTorch
mlflow          # For experiment tracking and model registry
evaluate        # Hugging Face evaluation library
rouge_score     # ROUGE metric for summarization
scikit-learn    # For additional metrics

# --- Phase 5: Deployment ---
fastapi         # For building the prediction API
uvicorn[standard] # ASGI server to run FastAPI

# --- Phase 6: Monitoring ---
evidently       # For data and model drift detection

# --- Phase 7: Dashboard ---
streamlit       # For the demo UI
